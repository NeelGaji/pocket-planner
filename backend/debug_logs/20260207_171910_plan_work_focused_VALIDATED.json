    "description": "This layout establishes a clear productivity hierarchy by placing the work table as the focal point against the windowed south wall, making it the first thing seen upon entry. The bed is relocated to the most distant corner along the west wall to create a distinct, non-distracting sleep zone. The living area is positioned opposite the bed, maintaining a wide, clear path from the door to the desk, reinforcing a work-first environment.",
    "furniture_placement": {
      "table_1": "Centered on the south wall, pushed flush against the wall directly under the two windows.",
      "chair_1": "Positioned at table_1, on the north side of the table, facing the south wall.",
      "chair_2": "Positioned at table_1, next to chair_1, also facing the south wall.",
      "bed_1": "In the northeast corner of the main living area, with the headboard pushed flush against the east wall. This places it away from the direct line of sight from the entrance.",
      "nightstand_1": "Placed against the east wall, on the north side of bed_1.",
      "nightstand_2": "Placed against the east wall, on the south side of bed_1.",
      "sofa_1": "Pushed flush against the center of the west wall, opposite the bed, keeping the central path clear.",
      "artwork_1": "Mounted on the west wall, centered above sofa_1.",
      "artwork_2": "Mounted on the east wall, centered above bed_1.",
      "plant_1": "Placed in the southeast corner of the room, between the desk and the bed area.",
      "rug_1": "Centered on the floor in the work zone, positioned under the front legs of table_1 and its chairs.",
      "rug_2": "Placed on the floor on the west side of bed_1, acting as a runner.",
      "lamp_1": "Placed on top of nightstand_1.",
      "lamp_2": "Placed on top of nightstand_2."
    },
    "door_clearance": "The central corridor from the door on the north wall to the table on the south wall is kept completely unobstructed, as all furniture is placed against the east, west, and south walls.",
    "zone_arrangement": {
      "work_zone": "The work zone is the primary focus, occupying the entire south wall to take advantage of natural light and establish a direct line-of-sight from the entrance.",
      "sleep_zone": "The sleep zone is discreetly tucked into the northwest area along the west wall, keeping it as far as possible from the work zone and out of the immediate view from the door.",
      "living_zone": "The living zone is arranged along the east wall, opposite the sleep zone, creating a secondary relaxation area that does not interfere with the main workflow path."
