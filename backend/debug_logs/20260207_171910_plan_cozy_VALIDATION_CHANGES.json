  "changes": [
    "Refined `artwork_1` placement: The original instruction referenced the sofa's old position. The new instruction centers it on the now-open west wall for better balance.",
    "Refined `artwork_2` placement: The original instruction was illogical ('above nightstand_2' on the east wall). The new instruction centers it on the east wall to balance the room.",
    "Replaced `rug_1` and `rug_2` with `area_rug_1`: Two small, separate rugs break up the space. A single large area rug is superior for the 'Cozy Retreat' style, as it unifies the bed and sofa into a cohesive relaxation zone."
