    "description": "This layout creates a central 'Cozy Retreat' by unifying the bed and sofa into a single lounging block, making it the immediate focal point upon entering. The work and kitchen areas are tucked to the side, preserving the main space for relaxation and sleep, while maintaining a clear, open flow from the entrance.",

      "nightstand_1": "Positioned to the left (west) of the bed's headboard, against the south wall.",
      "nightstand_2": "Positioned to the right (east) of the bed's headboard, against the south wall.",
      "sofa_1": "Placed at the foot of the bed (the north end), facing south towards the bed to form a cohesive lounging block.",
      "table_1": "Tucked into the northwest corner of the room, against the west wall and just south of the kitchenette.",
      "chair_1": "Placed at the table_1, on the east side, with its back to the main room.",

      "work_zone": "Contained in the northwest corner, adjacent to the kitchenette. This placement keeps work activities separate from the primary relaxation area and out of the direct line of sight from the entrance.",
      "sleep_zone": "Occupies the southern half of the room. The bed is the central feature, positioned against the far wall to create a sense of sanctuary.",
      "living_zone": "Fully integrated with the sleep zone. The sofa's placement at the foot of the bed creates a multi-purpose central island for relaxation, conversation, or watching media, embodying the 'Cozy Retreat' concept."
