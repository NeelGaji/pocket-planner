    "Relocated 'bed_1' from the west wall to the east wall. The proposed placement was too close to the main entrance, violating the rule that the bed should be hidden and not the first thing seen.",
    "Relocated 'sofa_1' from the east wall to the west wall to accommodate the bed's new, correct position and to maintain a clear, straight walking path from the door to the desk.",
    "Moved 'nightstand_1' and 'nightstand_2' to the east wall to flank the relocated bed.",
    "Moved 'artwork_1' to the west wall to be placed above the relocated sofa.",
    "Moved 'artwork_2' to the east wall to be placed above the relocated bed.",
    "Refined the placement of 'rug_2'. The original instruction was ambiguous; it is now specified as a runner next to the bed's new location.",
    "Adjusted 'plant_1' to the southeast corner to better define the corner between the desk and the new bed area."
